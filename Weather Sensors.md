__Weather Sensors__

All weather sensors can be defined by the user.

There are five sensors used in this system
- Current Temperature
- Forecast High Temperature Today
- Total Rainfall so far today: This is notoriously hard to get good data for unless you have a weather station of your own.
I use Smartweather to reasonably good effect but I know it is not available in all regions.
- Actual Rainfall yesterday

The fifth sensor needs to return any text string describing the weather outlook (or anything else you want!).

I have written some default sensors into the system but hey are easily changed from the settings page.

I think it is self explanatory but if this causes any questions in future I will update this page with advice
